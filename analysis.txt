Customer Churn Analysis

Overview
This analysis explores customer churn behavior using tenure length, monthly charges,
and contract characteristics. The dataset consists of 500 customer records with no
missing values.

Churn Rate Interpretation
An overall churn rate of 51.60% is relatively high and suggests a significant customer
retention challenge. This makes the dataset suitable for churn prediction modeling
and retention strategy evaluation.

Tenure and Churn
Customers who churned have an average tenure of 31.13 months, while customers who
did not churn have an average tenure of 40.53 months.
This indicates a negative relationship between tenure and churn, where customers
who stay longer are less likely to leave.

Monthly Charges and Churn
The average monthly charge for churned customers is 73.34, compared to 68.37 for
non-churned customers.
Higher monthly charges appear to be associated with a higher likelihood of churn,
suggesting price sensitivity or perceived lack of value.

Contract Type Influence
The churn probability calculation places higher risk on Month-to-Month contracts.
This aligns with typical business observations where flexible contracts lead to
higher churn compared to long-term commitments.

Visualization Insights
Boxplots show that churned customers tend to have higher monthly charges.
Count plots indicate that Month-to-Month customers experience higher churn counts
than customers on One Year or Two Year contracts.

Business Implications
 Focus retention efforts on early-tenure customers
 Offer incentives or discounts to high-paying customers
 Encourage long-term contracts to reduce churn risk

Next Steps
 Perform multivariate analysis including service tier
 Build a churn prediction model using logistic regression or tree-based methods
 Segment customers by churn risk for targeted retention strategies
