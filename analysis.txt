DELIVERABLE 3: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS & INTERPRETATION

Project: Analyzing Synthetic Customer Purchase Data

1. Age Distribution Analysis

The average customer age is 41.4 years, indicating a predominantly middle-aged
customer base. The interquartile range (30 to 52 years) shows that most customers
belong to active working-age groups. The moderate standard deviation suggests
balanced age diversity without extreme outliers.

2. Income Distribution Analysis

Income has a mean of 50,794 and a median of 50,660, indicating a near-symmetric
distribution. However, the wide range (15,000 to 97,510) and high standard
deviation reveal significant income inequality. This suggests the presence of
multiple economic segments within the customer population.

3. Purchase Amount Distribution Analysis

Purchase_Amount shows strong right-censoring at 2,000. The median, 75th percentile,
and maximum are all equal to 2,000, clearly indicating a spending ceiling.
Lower purchase values (minimum 795.08) pull the mean below the median, producing
a left-skewed distribution.

4. Visualization-Based Insights

Box plots of Purchase_Amount by Product_Category show that most categories have
median values near the 2,000 cap. Differences across categories are primarily
observed in the lower quartiles, suggesting variation in minimum spending rather
than maximum spending. This pattern supports the conclusion that purchases are
constrained by system rules rather than customer income.

5. Income vs Purchase Amount Relationship

Despite wide income variation, purchase amounts remain tightly clustered.
This indicates a weak or negligible relationship between Income and Purchase_Amount.
A scatter plot would show horizontal clustering around Purchase_Amount = 2,000,
confirming that income does not significantly influence spending in this dataset.

6. Business and Modeling Implications

 Purchase behavior is driven by fixed limits rather than customer purchasing power.
 Income is better suited for customer segmentation than spending prediction.
 Appropriate ML tasks include:
   Customer segmentation
   Product category classification
   Behavioral pattern analysis

7. Final Analytical Conclusion

This dataset demonstrates controlled purchasing behavior across diverse income
groups. The analysis highlights the importance of identifying system constraints
before drawing conclusions about customer spending patterns.
