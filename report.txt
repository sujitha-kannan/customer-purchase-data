REPORT: Exploratory Analysis of Synthetic Customer Churn Data

Dataset Overview: - Total Records: 500 - No missing values across all
variables.

Descriptive Statistics: The average customer tenure is 35.68 months with
a standard deviation of 20.81 months. Monthly charges average $70.93
with a standard deviation of $21.51. Charges range from $20.00 to
$133.49, while tenure ranges from 1 to 71 months.

Overall Churn Rate: The overall churn rate in the dataset is 51.60%,
indicating that slightly more than half of the customers in this
synthetic dataset have churned.

Bivariate Analysis Summary: Customers who churned have a higher average
monthly charge ($73.34) compared to non-churned customers ($68.37), a
difference of $4.98. Churned customers also exhibit a shorter average
tenure (31.13 months) than non-churned customers (40.53 months), a
difference of 9.40 months.

Contract Type and Churn: Month-to-Month contracts have the highest churn
rate at 60.75%. One Year and Two Year contracts show lower churn rates
at 40.77% and 41.90% respectively.

Conclusion: Higher monthly charges, shorter tenure, and month-to-month
contracts are associated with increased churn in this synthetic dataset.
