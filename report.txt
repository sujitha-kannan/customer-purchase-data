Dataset Creation
A synthetic customer churn dataset containing 500 records was generated using Python.
The dataset includes customer tenure, monthly charges, contract type, service tier,
and churn status.

Data Quality Check
A missing values check confirmed that there are no missing values in the dataset.
All variables are complete and suitable for analysis.

Variables Included
 TenureMonths: Number of months a customer has stayed with the company
 MonthlyCharge: Monthly billing amount charged to the customer
 ContractType: Type of customer contract (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)
 ServiceTier: Level of service subscribed (Basic, Standard, Premium)

TenureMonths:
 Mean: 35.68 months
 Minimum: 1 month
 Maximum: 71 months

MonthlyCharge:
 Mean: 70.93
 Minimum: 20.00
 Maximum: 133.49

Overall Churn Rate
The overall churn rate in the dataset is 51.60%, indicating that slightly more than
half of the customers have churned.

Bivariate Summary
 Average Monthly Charge (Churned): 73.34
 Average Monthly Charge (Not Churned): 68.37
 Average Tenure (Churned): 31.13 months
 Average Tenure (Not Churned): 40.53 months

Conclusion
The dataset is clean, well-structured, and appropriate for churn analysis and
predictive modeling. Initial patterns suggest that tenure and monthly charges
are important factors influencing customer churn.
