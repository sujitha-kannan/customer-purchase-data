ANALYSIS: Exploratory Analysis of Synthetic Customer Churn Data

Descriptive Statistics Analysis: Customer tenure is widely distributed,
with a median of 35 months and an interquartile range from 17 to 54
months. Monthly charges show moderate variability, with most values
falling between $57.32 and $85.27.

Churn Interpretation: The overall churn rate of 51.60% aligns with the
synthetic churn probability design, which assigns higher churn
likelihood to customers with higher charges and shorter tenure.

Bivariate Analysis Interpretation: Monthly Charges vs Churn: Customers
who churned pay on average $73.34 per month, while those who did not
churn pay $68.37. This $4.98 difference suggests higher costs contribute
to churn behavior.

Tenure vs Churn: Churned customers have an average tenure of 31.13
months compared to 40.53 months for non-churned customers, indicating
that longer tenure is associated with higher retention.

Contract Type vs Churn: Month-to-Month customers show substantially
higher churn (60.75%) compared to One Year (40.77%) and Two Year
(41.90%) contracts, reinforcing the relationship between contract
commitment and churn reduction.
