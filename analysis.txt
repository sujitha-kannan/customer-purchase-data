Customer Churn Analysis

Data Integrity and Distribution
The dataset shows strong data integrity with zero missing values across all variables. Numerical variables such as tenure and monthly charges exhibit reasonable ranges and variability, suggesting realistic customer behavior patterns.

Churn Rate Interpretation
An overall churn rate of 51.60% is relatively high and suggests a potential retention issue. This level of churn warrants deeper investigation into customer behavior and service-related factors.

Tenure and Churn Relationship

Customers who churned have an average tenure of 31.13 months.

Customers who remained have a significantly higher average tenure of 40.53 months.

This indicates a negative relationship between tenure and churn, where longer-tenured customers are less likely to leave. Customer loyalty appears to strengthen over time.

Monthly Charges and Churn Relationship

Churned customers pay an average of 73.34 per month.

Non-churned customers pay an average of 68.37 per month.

Higher monthly charges are associated with increased churn, suggesting price sensitivity or perceived lack of value among higher-paying customers.

Behavioral Insights

Newer customers with higher monthly charges represent a higher churn risk.

Longer-tenured customers are more stable, even with moderate pricing.

Implications for Business Strategy

Introduce retention incentives for early-tenure customers.

Review pricing strategies or add value for customers with higher monthly charges.

Use tenure and monthly charge as key predictors in churn prediction models.

Next Steps

Perform multivariate analysis including contract type and service tier.

Build a churn prediction model using tenure and monthly charges as primary features.

Segment customers by risk level to design targeted retention campaigns.
